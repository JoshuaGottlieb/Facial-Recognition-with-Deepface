            'f1_score': F1-Measure. Attempts to balance precision and recall on the positive class (images match).
                        Less precise than matthew_cc, with slightly better recall. Threshold = 0.293939
            'balanced_acc': Balanced Accuracy. Maximizes accuracy across class imbalances. Prediction favors matching the
                            underlying distribution of the data, which tends to favor the negative class (images do not
                            match) and has low precision, which may result in more false positives. Threshold = 0.447475
            'precision': Precision; positive predictive value. Emphasizes that predictions on the positive class (images
                         match) should come from the positive class, reducing the number of false positives. High
                         precision naturally reduces the ability to identify any positive predictions, which may lead to
                         low identification rate for matching images; i.e., low recall. Threshold = 0.253535
        threshold_strictness: int representing the number of successively less strict thresholds to test.
                              Valid options range from 1 to 5. Used to allow looser matches along similar threshold criterion.
